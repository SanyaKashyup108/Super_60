            { question: "What is JSX in React and why is it useful?", answer: "JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React that allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript files. This makes the code more readable and easier to visualize the structure of the component. JSX is compiled into regular JavaScript." },
            { question: "What are Functional Components in React?", answer: "Functional components are JavaScript functions that return React elements. They are simpler than class components and allow you to write components." },
            { question: "Why is the Virtual DOM important?", answer: "The Virtual DOM is a concept where React maintains an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. When changes occur, React first applies them to the Virtual DOM, calculates the minimal difference (diffing), and then updates the real DOM accordingly. This results in better performance, especially in large applications, as unnecessary DOM manipulations are avoided." }

            { question: "What are middleware functions in Express.js?", answer: "Middleware functions in Express are functions that execute during the request-response cycle. They can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, request parsing, and error handling. Middleware allows you to write reusable, modular logic that can be applied globally or to specific routes in your application." },
            { question: "Why is Node.js considered non-blocking?", answer: "Node.js is built on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle multiple operations concurrently without waiting for one to complete before starting another. This is especially beneficial for building scalable network applications, where high concurrency is crucial." },
            { question: "What is Express.js and how does it help?", answer: "Express.js is a lightweight web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building server-side applications. It provides a robust set of features for routing, middleware, request handling, and more. Express is highly extensible and widely used in full-stack JavaScript applications." }

            { question: "How to increase attendance in virtual events?", answer: "To boost attendance, promote your event through social media, email marketing, influencer outreach, and partnerships. Offer compelling content, an easy registration process, and clear value propositions. Sending reminders and offering on-demand access afterward can also help attract more participants." },
            { question: "What are common challenges in virtual events?", answer: "Common challenges include technical glitches, low engagement, and limited networking opportunities. To overcome these, ensure a reliable platform, prepare contingency plans, use interactive tools like polls and Q&A sessions, and create networking breakout rooms for participants." },
            { question: "What metrics should be tracked for virtual events?", answer: "Important metrics include total registrations, live attendance rate, average session duration, engagement (poll responses, chat messages), and post-event feedback. These insights help you evaluate performance and improve future virtual events." }

            { question: "What is a Redux reducer?", answer: "A reducer is a pure function in Redux that takes the current state and an action as input and returns a new state. It determines how the application's state should change in response to an action. Reducers must be predictable and should not mutate the state directly. Instead, they should return a new object representing the updated state." },
            { question: "When should Redux be preferred over Context API?", answer: "Redux is best suited for large-scale applications where state is complex and needs to be shared across many components. It provides powerful tools like middleware, time-travel debugging, and a centralized store. In contrast, the Context API is simpler and better suited for smaller apps with limited state management needs." },
            { question: "What are middleware and how are they used in Redux?", answer: "Redux middleware are functions that intercept actions before they reach the reducer. They can be used to handle side effects like asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls), logging, error handling, or modifying actions. Common middleware libraries include redux-thunk and redux-saga." }
